# hello-world
test repository

This is a test repository so I can learn GIT.  I've used lot of other versioning repostories in the past, but this is what the team is using so I wll try with this first.

Also am exploring this as a way of keeping track of implementation or other projects.

I am always looking for ways to improve upon what we are doing today or how we are doing it in service to our customers.  So anything that can be automated, or shared (as far as information) should be made available to everyone else in the company that works with customers.
